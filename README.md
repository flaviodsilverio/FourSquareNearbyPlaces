Hi,

Sorry for taking so long to deliver something but, against all odds, I had an unusually busy work week last week and couldn't advance a lot of the project when I got home thanks to being tired.

Now to the project:

My goal was to have a working project. 
I didn't want to follow the RxSwift way, but I wanted to have something that could be easily testable, so I did go on a MVVM-ish route as for what architecture is concerned. 
I did end up not writting any tests though, I clearly failed there.

My primary goal was to have something that would act similarly to Costa's coffee location feature, I even used the google API (like Costa) for the location autocomplete.
I tried to write everything by myself and only used a single CocoaPod, which was SwiftLint. 
I did struggle a bit with the maps part, as I hadn't worked with them in a very long time, but at the end of the day I think I did create something that goes according to what the test was expecting.

I wait any feedback you might have, be it good or bad.

Cheers
